                <p>
                    I am a sophomore at NYU pursuing a joint major in Computer Science and Data Science 
                    with a minor in Web Programming And Applications. I have experience programming in Java, Python, and C#
                    and am independently studying HTML, CSS, Javascript, and mySQL. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in working with machine learning and artificial intelligence on projects like Atlas at
                    Boston Dynamics and despite many controversies and concerns, I want to work towards building 
                    AGI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">(Artificial General Intelligence)</a>. 
                    Despite many claiming AGI is an impossible fantasy, I believe that with many technological
                    advancements and innovations, the idea is within our reach in the future.

                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, trying new resturants and cafes, cooking, and mixed martial arts for fun.
                    I've made it my mission to find the best cafes in NYC so here are a few of my favorites.

                                <h2>SEY Coffee</h2>
                                <p>
                                    SEY Coffee is a small cafe with only one location in Brooklyn, NY. The space is alive with people and plants
                                    with plenty of natural light for a more natural environment. The inside is constructed with wood and concrete
                                    to give the cafe more of a natural feel. <br>
                                    A con for though is that the cafe does not allow laptops on weekends and is limited on weekdays; however, I do
                                    see the benefit in disconnecting from technology for a second and just living in the moment. Seats are tough to 
                                    find though since the cafe is usually busy on weekends, so it may be hard to sit down and enjoy your drink.

                                <h2>Blue Bottle Coffee</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Blue Bottle is one of my favoriate coffee shops and is probably my go to pick when it comes to cafes. Their store locations
                                    are consitently designed well with a lot of though put into the atmosphere of the cafe. Their coffee is also top notch and ethically
                                    sourced which justifies the price. <br>
                                    Aside from the price of the coffee, I personally don't find many flaws with these cafes. They are usually great to work at and provide
                                    a nice ambiance to focus in. I love the location in NYC Chinatown since it is large and has many seats, but if I don't want to go that far
                                    they're still many locations around me.

                                <h2>Philz Coffee</h2>
                                <p>
                                    What I love about Philz is their coffee and creations. If I had to choose a cafe that I consistently got the best coffee
                                    from, I think it might be Philz. When I had a hybrid internship in the bay my freshman summer, just about every remote day
                                    I went to the nearby Philz to work. <br>
                                    Philz started in California and is not that big of a chain so unfortunately, they only have locations in California and Chicago 
                                    right now though I hope they'll open one in NYC soon.
